SAIT Web Developer Fast Track
## House Rules
- Cameras on:
    1. 8-9am
    2. During breakout discussions and when paired coding
    3. During fishbowl discussions (if you're speaking)
    4. After 2pm
- Be an excellent neighbour:
    - People are allowed to like (and not like) things;
    - Work the problem before asking for help;
    - Teach a skill you've learned.
- Ask a question any time during a live stream.
- One-on-ones: DM your instructor anytime to book a time for a confidential video/audio chat. Note: this is not for tutoring, see below.

## Getting help

### Slack best practices
- `@mention` someone if it's important or a direct reply to someone's message. Don't over use it, though.
- Can your question be answered by a classmate? Consider posting it in `#winter-2021` instead of DMing your instructor. The answer will probably be of use to the rest of the group (don't forget to work the problem yourself, first).
- Don't wait for someone to be online before asking them a question. Just ask the question and give the person some time to respond.
    - Examples of flawed Slack messages:
        - "Hi @tony"
        - "@tony I'd like to ask a question"
    - Examples of great Slack messages:
        - "I can't figure out how to move this button to the left. Any ideas? Screencap attached!"
        - "@classmate Free at 5pm for a strategy chat? If not, I'm free tomorrow during lunch."
- Want to meet any past grads? Post a message in `#general`.
