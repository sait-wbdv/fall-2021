# Layout
## List entries (example: gallery)
List entry
: Sometimes called "category pages" (when they contain items belonging to a specific product category), "directory pages" (when they list locations or people), or "gallery pages" (when they contain graphics or images).

Pogo sticking
: Navigating from a routing page—a search-engine results page (SERP), section landing page, product-category page, or similar—to a page deeper in the site’s hierarchy, then immediately back to the routing page

To avoid the need for the user to pogo stick:
1. **Prioritize list-entry attributes to create an information hierarchy**
    The amount of product detail in the list entry needs to be just right: too much will overload users and prevent them from seeing enough choices in one view, too little will make them pogo stick.
2. **Reflect attribute priorities in the mini-IA and visual design of each list entry**
    Treat each list entry as if it were a small webpage and make sure that your layout and visual treatment of each attribute within that description matches its priority relative to other attributes.
3. **Use consistent styling across list entries to support comparison**
     In other words, the same piece information should be represented in the same place using the same visual treatment. (See: the amazon example in [Design principles: Repetition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhhc5pzE9Y) [@2:28](https://youtu.be/8zhhc5pzE9Y?t=148))

## Cards
Definition
: A card is container for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit.

**Cards have 4 key properties**:
- Cards are used for grouping information. 
- Cards present a summary and link to additional details.
- Cards resemble physical cards.
- Cards allow for flexible layouts.

**When Cards Are Useful**:
- Cards are better suited when users browse for information than when they search.
    - Card layouts typically deemphasize the ranking of content.
    - Card layouts are less scannable than lists.
    - Cards take more space.
- Cards work best for collections of heterogeneous items (i.e. not all the content is of the same basic type).
