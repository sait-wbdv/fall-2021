title: Web accessibility
description: Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

## WGAC 2.1 Four Principles
1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
