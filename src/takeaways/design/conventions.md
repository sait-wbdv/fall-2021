## Terminology
Convention
: A widely used or standard web design pattern.

### Common web conventions
Conventions are popular design patterns that evolve over time as the user becomes more knowledgeable. Your audience will have pre-defined expectations that fall into three general categories:
1. Where things are located on a page. Example: login button -> top right.
2. How things work. Example: the shopping cart metaphor.
3. How things look. Example: errors are red and like buttons are blue.
