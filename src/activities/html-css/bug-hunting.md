## Overview
- The following links are to a bunch of broken html and css code. Your job is to fix them so that the designs work.
  - The bugs include both syntax and logic issues, some designs have a lot of problems
  - In a lot of cases, figuring out the correct order of fixes will be an important task. This is good practice for bug hunting on projects out in thewild
- Feel free to get creative, these designs are all quite lackluster and could do with some improvements.

### Steps
1. Fork a codepen that you want to work on
2. Find the bugs and fix them
3. Write down brief notes in a markdown file on how you approached solving the issues
  - This is primarily to develop your strategic thinking for solving coding problems
  - We will be discussing these problem solving methods in the next class.
4. Submit the link to your codepen and the zipped markdown file to Brightspace

## Code Collection
- I've put all the broken code in this [codepen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/kNPvvR)
