title: Use Flexbox and Grid Together
description: Flexbox and grid solve design problems differently. Use them together to take advantage of their strengths.
---

## Instructions

- Create something that incorporates both flexbox and grid
- Card layouts are good for this sort of thing. However, with these two systems, you have amazing power to work with. For different ideas:
  - Reflect on design conventions discussed in DSGN-270
  - check out [Jen Simmons Labs](https://labs.jensimmons.com) for ideas
  - Look at your favourite websites, find a part of a page and use it for inspiration
- Submit either a codepen link or zipped html and css files to Brightspace
