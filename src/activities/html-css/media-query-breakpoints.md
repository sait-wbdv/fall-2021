title: Mobile first Breakpoints
description: Add breakpoints to a webpage with media queries

---

## Instructions
1. Do one of the following
  - Take one of the pages that you have previously made and refactor it to use media queries
  - Create a new page layout using the flexbox and media queries that we worked with today
2. Decide on whether you want to serve a mobile or desktop layout at the default, then create a media query for the other one
  - set this by using min-width or max-width
  - In the readings for today, there is a freecodecamp article that has some great suggestions for breakpoints if you want to get really specific
3. make a design that has a distinct layout between mobile and desktop screen sizes
  - at mobile
    - content should be in a single column (much of this can be done with flexbox on it's own)
  - at desktop
    - More content can be displayed beside other content
    - for some displays, you will need to use media queries to make some content disappear, and other content to use different flex properties
