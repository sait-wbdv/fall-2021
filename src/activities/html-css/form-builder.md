## Task Instructions
- Use the topic and outline from the morning activity to:
  - Create a form
  - It should include 2-3 of:
    - text input
    - radio buttons
    - checkboxes
    - a dropdown
    - a submit button
- NOTE: If a feature really doesn't make sense, then leave it out. Minimalism often good in user forms
  - if you find that you're not getting to try using all of the form input types, make a second form and try using them there.
- Use accessibility best practices
  - [Mdn collection of article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
  - [FreeCodeCamp Applied Accessibility](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#applied-accessibility)
- Stylize your form so that it is responsive
- Submit either a codepen or zipped html + css to Brightspace
