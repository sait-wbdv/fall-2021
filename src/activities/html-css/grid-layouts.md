## Instructions
- Find a website layout that inspires you
- Choose a specific colour scheme
    - example scheme template:
    - light color (a variant of white)
    - dark color (a variant of black)
    - primary theme color (brand main color)
    - accent color (complimentary color)
- Use CSS Grid to create the overall site layout
  - Wrapping the whole page in a `div` is recommended but not necessary
  - Use [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com) for layout code
    - If you're feeling spicy, create your own layout
- Use flexbox to stylize the layout of the specific sections (header, main, section...) as we've been doing in class
- When Finished, either send the github link or codepen link to Brightspace
  - Even if you're not happy with your design or it's broken, submit what you've got - This will help me know how to better offer support.
