## Instructions

- Use hero sections found in the hero hunt activity as inspiration, but build with new assets and text
- Your hero section should take up the majority or all of the screen before the fold
- The text should be very clear ontop of the background image
- Your call to action should draw the user's attention
  - approaches to do this (use at least 2):
    - colour
    - contrast
    - pseudo class :hover
    - border-shadow
    - transform
    - position and relation to other elements
    - position and relation to details on the background
- Call to action does not need to be active
