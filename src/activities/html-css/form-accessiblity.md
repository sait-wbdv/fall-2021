## Pair Code Instructions
- Work together in a team of 4
  - Use a pair coding format where 2 people are in driver-navigator roles.
  - You can do this in a few different ways:
    - Divide up the page and have each pair work on their section
      - It can be good to work synchronously (only 1 pair coding at a time), but asynchronous coding can also work well (however this approach can lead to more code errors)
    - Work through the form from top to bottom, pair coding in timed intervals as you go
      - This method is especially good if nobody has any strong opinions of what part of the page they want to work on.
    - Divide based on html and css
  - In the end, everyone should get to be driver and navigator
