## Instructions
- Create a sliding nav menu using a css checkbox hack or supplied javascript
- For this exercise, it does not need to change to a desktop layout (however this will be necessary for assignments)
- There should be no horizontal scroll
- The menu should not be visible at all in the off state
- Use transitions for smooth animation
