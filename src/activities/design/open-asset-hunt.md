Using the [Open-source Assets Collection]({{ '/open-assets/' | url }}), and/or any other resources you can find online, collect the following openly licensed assets that centre around a topic of your choice:

1. Converted to markdown or HTML (valid markup required): at least 500 words of openly-licensed text (i.e. you **don't** have to write original content) describing or relating to your topic. It should contain a mix of the following:
    - level 1 and 2 headings;
    - body text;
    - ordered or unorded lists;
    - links to other resources;
    - bold text;
    - italicized text.
2. 9-12 images that are at least 1500px in the longest dimension.
3. One (or more, if desired) vector icon/graphic, in SVG format, that represents your topic and can serve as a logo.
