## Convention hunt
Your instructor didn't have time to add images of common web design conventions. Help him out:
1. Browse through this list of [common UI Design Patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns) and search for more.
2. Find real world examples of web conventions. What's the name of the convention?
3. What conventions can you find in software on devices that are not phones, laptops, etc? 
4. Take a screen capture (not the whole screen, please) of the best/worst and post the images (with the name of the convention and a link to the website) to #winter-2021.
