  - Connect it to your github account (or to your computer if you started with github)
  - Add a license (MIT)
  - Add a Readme
    - Inside the Readme:
      - add an h1 project title
        - underneath it briefly describe the theme (1 sentence)
      - add an h2 attributions title
- Push to Github

### Project Setup
- create an assets directory
- create an images directory **inside** the assets directory
- create `full/`, `lg/`, `md/`, `sm/` inside the `images/` directory  
- Push to Github

### Acquire Assets
- Find 3-6 images (they dont actually have to be themed, it can be totally random, just make your heading reflect that)
- store them in the `full` directory
- Push to Github

### Organize Assets
- relabel the images to a logical uniform system with no capitals or spaces
- Add attributions for each image to a README in the `images` directory
- Push to Github
