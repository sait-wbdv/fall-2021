---
## Scenario
You are the only UX/UI savvy dev on your team development team for a mobile app. After an initial requirements meeting, you realize a little UX will help the team visualize their work.

You decide to create a small proof of concept document to hopefully get buy-in from your teammates.

## Instructions
1. Select a mobile website of your choice or make one up. 
2. In 50 words or less, summarize the purpose of the website to provide context for the rest of this assignment.
3. Create 3 User Stories related to the website in one unordered list.
4. For one of the User Stories, create one 5-step (at least) User Flow as a numbered list.
5. Create at least 3 mobile wireframe screens to support the chosen user flow.

## Marking Criteria
This assignment will be marked out of 25 points, which will be given for each of the following:

### User stories: 10 points
- Stories should the following grammatical format (or similar): 
    > As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value].
- Each story should fit the INVEST set of criteria.
- Stories should be presented as an unordered markdown list.

### Task flow: 5 points
The task flow should: 
- have the same starting point for all users;
- be 5 tasks or more;
- show only one path and not show branches;
- end in success;
- be presented as a numbered markdown list.

Each task should be:
- short and concise;
- be user-centric (no system processes included);
- focus on actions that trigger screen or layout transitions. 
    - For example: "user submits form" instead of "user enters username..."

### Wireframe: 5 points
- Screens should be low-fidelity.
- Annotate your wireframes with Task Flow step numbers and arrows.
- All wireframe screens should be included in the markdown file as a single image no larger than an 8"x10" printed page (can be either portrait or landscape) and embedded as a markdown image.

### Markdown: 5 points
- Use correct markdown syntax.
- Do not use HTML.
- Presentational markdown should be limited to horizontal rules.
- Tables should be semantic and be limited to tabular data (don't use tables for layout).
