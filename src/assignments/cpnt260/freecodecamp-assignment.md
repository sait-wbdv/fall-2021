2. In each screencap, make sure you are logged in and that your profile pic is included in the image.
3. Upload your screencaps to Brightspace and include a link to your Free Code Camp profile page in the comments of the submission.

## Marking Rubric
These exercises will be marked out of 20 points. Your mark will be proportional to the number of exercises you complete. For example, if you complete half the exercises, your mark will be 20 points x 50% = 10 points.

**Suggested Strategy**: To maximize your mark, complete the easiest of the exercises first and go back later to complete the more difficult ones.
