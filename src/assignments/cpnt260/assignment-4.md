  - hero section with a call to action
  - content section that provides general information about the site
  - third party integration
  - form (can be a separate page if you prefer)
  - footer

## Marking Rubric

Each of the following will be marked out of 4 points (for a total of 20 points), based on the requirements below:

### Code Quality

- Page is marked up with proper semantic structural elements
  - `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `footer`
- Accessibility best practices
  - contrast ratio below AA for text size
  - images have proper alt text
- Use best practices with file/directory names, commenting, and indentation
  - 2 spaces per indent
  - no spaces in file names, use dashes or underscores instead
  - In general, use lower case characters except for README file name and DOCTYPES
  - Filenames should be short but descriptive (< 25 characters)

### 1. Hero Section

- at least 1 **locally hosted** image using either HTML or CSS
- a heading using `h1` tag
- a tagline using `p` tag
- a call to action
  - using a `a` or `button` element that connects to your form section

### 3. Third Party Integration and Page Content

- Integrate a third party app onto your page

  - Google Maps, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok...
  - this can't be a static image
  - the content can be only loosly relevant to the site subject matter

### 2. Form Section

- Integrate a third party contact form using a form submission service such as [formspree](https://formspree.com)
  - Your call to action should take the user to this
  - It can be on a different page
    - if on a different page, you must keep the nav and footer

### 3. Responsiveness

- Hero section text is readable at all screen widths
  - text does not overlap with a busy image
  - if overlap, use backgrounds and shading so the text stands out
- Background images can be removed on mobile
- `font-size` is smaller on mobile than on desktop
- Navigation bar is usable on mobile screen
- There is a scroll-track along the side on mobile
- text is readable at all widths

### 4. Hamburger Menu

- Site navigation should be responsive and switch to a hamburger menu at small screen widths
- Hamburger menu should visually indicate interactivity

### 5. Project Documentation

- Include a `README.md` in your project that contains:
  - Course Title:
  - Author Name:
  - Links to
    - Github Repo
    - Github Pages
  - Code Review (less than 500 words or point form)
    - Outline a bug that you ran into
    - How did you fix it?
    - What benefits/limits came out of your solution beyond the immediate goal
  - Attributions
  
## Submission Requirements

- Push this assignment to a repo named cpnt260-a4
- ZIP all files required for the site to operate and upload to Brightspace.
- Leave a link to the following as a comment in your Brightspace submission (this is duplicated in your readme but comes in handy sometimes):
- GH repo
- GH Pages site
