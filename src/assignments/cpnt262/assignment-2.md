title: CPNT 262 Assignment 2 - Dynamic Image Gallery
---
In this assignment you'll be refactoring your past 260 gallery assignment into a Javascript-driven gallery:
- Gallery information will be stored in an array of objects;
- The array will be converted to HTML using a loop;
- The HTML elements will be outputted to an HTML page.

You may use the same images you used for CPNT 260 or you can choose different ones. All images must be openly licensed or your own works.

## Criteria
This assignment will be marked out of 10 points according to the following requirements:

### 1. Image Array: 2 Points
- Array of 9-12 image object literals, declared as a `const` variable.
- For each image object, store the following information:
  - `id` - Unique identifier (`number`);
  - `title` - Image heading (`string`);
  - `description` - Image description (`string`: 10-25 words);
  - `width` - Image width in pixels (`number`);
  - `height` - Image height in pixels (`number`);
  - `pathURL` - a local path to your image file(`string`);
  - `linkURL` - 3rd party web page that the image links to (`string`; example: wikipedia entry relating to the image);
  - `credit` - The photo credit for the image such as a person, company or website (`string`).
  - `creditURL` - A link to the original photo, photographer's home page, license details, etc (`string`).

### 2. Array Loop and Output: 4 Points
- Using `Array.prototype.forEach()` or similar method/statement, loop through the image array and output to an HTML page.
- Within each loop iteration, either:
  - output image information directly to an HTML gallery, OR
  - append to an `output` variable to be outputted at the end of the loop.
- HTML output can be achieved with either:
  - `Element.innerHTML`;
  - Direct DOM manipulation (i.e. `Document.createElement()`, etc);
  - the use of a `<template>` element.
- Gallery HTML should be valid and semantic (i.e. `figure`/`figcaption` elements or similar).
- All information contained in the object should be used:
  - `id` is optional;
  - `width` and `height` are for image attributes. 
- Photo credit information can be displayed once on the page if it is the same for all images (but still must be included in the image objects)

### 3. Setup and Deployment: 2 points
- Images
  - Images must be locally hosted with your project.
  - Image resolution should be appropriate for the final display size in the viewport.
  - The gallery must be responsive and accessible.
- Javascript
  - Javascript must be linked in the `head` of the document and located in a dedicated `js` directory. Optional: ES modules.
  - Javascript must use _strict_ mode.
  - There must be no JS errors or warnings (except for favicon).
- CSS
  - CSS must be linked as an external stylesheet in the `head` of the document and located in a dedicated `css` directory.
  - While the goal of this assignment is not design, points will be deducted for accessibility/usability issues.

### 4. Documentation and Code Quality: 2 Points
1. Include a `README.md` in your project that contains the following information:
    - Course title;
    - Author name;
    - Links to:
      - GH repo;
      - GH Pages site
    - Some context/hints on where to look for the requirements above.
    - Attributions for any code or assets that are not your own.
2. Use best practices with [file/directory names](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/naming-conventions/), commenting and indentation:
    - 2 spaces per indent.
    - CamelCase naming conventions followed.
    - Statements ended with semi-colons.
    - Code is well-commented.
    - See [JavaScript Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) for full list.
