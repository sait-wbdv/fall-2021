## Project Achievements
Points will be awarded for documentation of your final project prior to the Final Presentations.

### Documentation
1. Project Proposal: **10 points**
    - Write a professional-level proposal for your final project.
    - Detailed requirements to be announced on Day 1.
2. Lean Canvas: **10 points**
    - Document Plan A of your final project using Lean Canvas
    - Detailed requirements to be announced on Day 1.
3. Flowchart/Pseudo-code diagram: **5 points**
4. Wireframes: **5 points**
5. Design Mockups/Composites: **5 points**
6. Task Board: **1 point per feature** (max 10 points)
    - Using GH Projects, Trello or similar task tracking tool:
        1. Optional: Create a "Final Presentation" repo for your tasks.
        2. Create a card representing a task you need to complete for your final presentation. Put it in a _To Do_, _Backlog_ or similar list.
        3. To submit: Take screencap of project board and total your point for a single Brightspace submission.
    - A "Task" is loosely defined but it should be a non-trivial activity that brings you closer to your Final Presentation project. Examples:
        - "Implement personal access token for _GitHub_ API"
        - "Create logic flowchart for sign-in process"
        - "Create image gallery from JSON data using fetch and a loop"
    - Tasks should be submitted in good faith: no cheesy tasks like "tie shoelaces".

Note: A project proposal can be combined with lean canvas documentation for a combined **15 points**. All other items can be built independently or as supporting documentation for a Proposal/Canvas.
