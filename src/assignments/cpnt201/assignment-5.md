title: CPNT 201 Assignment 5 - SASS and CSS Frameworks
---

## Summary

This assignment will give you some practice using modern css tools.

You will be adding styles to your repo from assignment 4. However instead of using vanilla css, you will use a css framework or sass/scss.

### How to choose your tech stack

- If you really like writing custom css, use sass/scss
- If you want predefined defaults and minimal setup/personalization, use bootstrap
- If you want a balance of defaults and customization, use tailwind

All 3 of the above mentioned tools are very powerful. Each lends themself to different design strategies.
