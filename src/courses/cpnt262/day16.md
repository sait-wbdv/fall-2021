    ```js
    GET /api/your-object-here
    GET /api/your-object-here/:id

## 1. Higher order functions with `array.find()`
### Terminology
Higher order function
: A function that hides (abstracts) information so we can tackle a problem at a higher (more abstract level). Examples: [`Array.forEach()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach), [`Array.filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), [`Array.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find).

### Materials
- Search: ["js higher order functions"](https://www.google.com/search?q=js+higher+order+functions)
- Reference
    - [Array.prototype.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
- Gists: 
    - [Find a value in an array](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/385b2f850d4881364ac7b0da320f239a)
    - [Find an object in an array](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/fec626b5701beeed49cea776fc354325)

### Key Takeaways
- `Array.find()` loops through an array of objects and expects a Boolean return value:
    - If `true` is returned, the loops stops and `Array.find()` returns the current item;
    - If `false` is returned, the loop continues to the next item;
    - If no items are found by the end of the loop, `Array.find()` returns `undefined`.
- This method is considered a higher order function, meaning it hides (abstracts) information so we can tackle a problem at a higher (more abstract level). In this case, `Array.find()` hides the fact that it's looping through the array (and that it operations differently based on a boolean result).

### Activity: Practice with `Array.find()`
1. Find your array from your Gallery `.forEach()` assignment (or some other array of Objects);
2. Choose a property (with a string or number value) within your objects to test against;
3. Using `process.argv` and `Array.find()`, create a command line app that returns the item that matches the `inputValue` that is passed from the command line OR print a "Please try again" statement if no items were found.
