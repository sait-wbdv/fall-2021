# Day 9: Progressive Enhancement
  - include a lot of stuff from Jen and Rachel
    - Jen Simmons Youtube Unlocking the power of overrides
- Do a lot of this earlier and add something else here

## Goals
* Create css that will accomodate different browsers
* Be able to alter a design so that it will still look on any device

## Learning Objectives
  - How to use the `@supports` tag
  - how to test and check for feature support

## Bruteforce
* Use code snippits from [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/patterns/) to create a progressively enhanced layout
* Use feature queries to add progressive enhancement to a previously made design

## Stretch
* Create a design that **will** break under certain conditions, and fix it with progressive enhancement
  * Code should offer a slightly different but good quality experience for all users
