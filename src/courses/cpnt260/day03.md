main-axis
  : This is defined by the `flex-direction`. If your flex-direction is set to row _(this is the default)_, then the main axis is horizontal. If your flex-direction is set to column, then the main axis is vertical.
    - items are set along this axis by using `justify-content`
cross-axis
  : This is the other axis of a flex layout. It changes depending on your flex-direction
    - Items are positioned along this axis by using `align-items`
