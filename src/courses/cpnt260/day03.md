## Topic 1: Introduction to Flexbox
_Create responsive and interesting designs with flexbox_

### Key Terms
`display`
  : This property is used to set the layout of an element and its children. Read more in [this Mdn article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)
main-axis
  : This is defined by the `flex-direction`. If your flex-direction is set to row _(this is the default)_, then the main axis is horizontal. If your flex-direction is set to column, then the main axis is vertical.
    - items are set along this axis by using `justify-content`
cross-axis
  : This is the other axis of a flex layout. It changes depending on your flex-direction
    - Items are positioned along this axis by using `align-items`

flex item
  : Children of flex containers. Use properties such as `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `align-self` to customize how flex items look and function
