## Topic 1: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Key Terms
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
  : The standard language for documents that will be displayed on the web. It uses tags to structure and describe types of information. **The content**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

JS (JavaScript)
  : A multi-paradigm scripting/programming language that enables websites with advanced interactive features. Originally a frontend browser focused language, it has now been extended to be a backend language. **content interactivity**
DOM (Document Object Model)
