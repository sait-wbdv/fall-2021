# CPNT-260 Day 8: Positions, Transitions, and Visibility

## Goal
* How to animate elements with transitions and keyframes
* How to hide different types of elements
* How to position elements differently in the flow of the document
* Custom variables in CSS
 
## Learning Objectives
* Correct uses of `position` values such as `absolute`, and `relative`
* when to use `display`, `visibility`, and `opacity` to effect visiblity
* use of `transition` to make elements interactive
* `keyframes` and how to use them differently from `transitions`

## Bruteforce
* Set up a UI interaction hierarchy with page content using `transitions`
* Uses of visibility in responsive design
* Apply a color scheme

## Stretch
* Use of cubic-bezier to effect flow of interactive elements
* keyframe design for advanced animation
