## Friday Finals Checklist
1. Profile consistency
    - Decide on the social sites you will be using for your professional work.
    - Pick an avatar (i.e. profile pic) and use it on all your these socials: GitHub, Codepen, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
    - When possible, cross link your socials. For example: fill out "Profile Links" in your Codepen Profile. 
2. GitHub
    - Repo cleaning: Set any unneeded repos to Private.
    - Repo polish: Comment and refactor any repos that stay public.
    - Repo naming: Rename past assignments that will remain public. For example: `cpnt260-a2` -> `team-card` or similar.
3. Personal/Porfolio website
    - What will you use for your primary website?
    - Will you use a custom domain?
    - What is your goal for the summer? Find a practicum? Find a contract? Focus on more learning with an eye for paying projects? Float down the river?
4. Friday Presentation
    - Will you present individually (5 mins) or as a group (10 mins)?
    - Who is the target audience for your presentation? Remember, presentations will be recorded and publicized to potential employers. You also receive a copy for your own uses.
    - What will be your primary message to your audience?
        - I've got a great eye for design. Check out this colour and form!
        - I've been a coder for just 4 months. Here's an example of how I solve difficult problems.
        - Look at how I learned can learn something not covered in class! 
        - Here's an example of how I've collaborated in a team.
        - Check out how DRY this code is!
        - My idea is awesome (with supporting evidence)!

You've worked hard this semester. Friday let's keep Friday fun, although kinda terrifying.
