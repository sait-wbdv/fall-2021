    - This app has an option for creating a Lean Canvas, which we'll cover in class.

### Key Takeaways
- Key agile principle: Don't build a product nobody wants.
- Build an Minimal Viable Product with one or two features and get it in front of Early Adopters. The missing feature they complain most about should be your focus for the next iteration.
- Lean canvas method:
    1. Document your _Plan A_ with a Lean Canvas
    2. Identify the riskiest parts of your plan
    3. Empirically test your plan
- Recommended order to complete a lean canvas sections:
    1. Customer segment: Target customers and users.
    2. Top 3 Problems experienced by your segment.
    3. Unique Value Proposition: A single, clear compelling message that turns an unaware visitor into an interested prospect (elevator pitch).
    4. Solution: Outline a possible solution for each problem.
    5. Customer channels: List your path to customers.
    6. Revenue streams: List your sources of revenue.
    7. Cost structure: List your fixed and variable costs.
    8. Key Metrics: List the key numbers that tell you how your business is doing.
    9. Unfair Advantage: Something that can't be easily copied or bought.
