## Homework
1. Tool time
    - Read: [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
        - Markdown will be used to write your GitHub README files (the file nerds use to document their projects). Github converts your markdown into HTML.
2. Mental Models
    - Watch: [UX Design Basics - Mental Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gM8K4ooavY) by Jamal Nichols
    - Find an example of good/bad/vital product design (a handy tool, piece of equipment, etc) in your immediate(ish) area (home, office, vehicle, etc). You will be discussing your find in a group of 3 or 4 tomorrow.
