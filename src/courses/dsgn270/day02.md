        4. Site Search Often Works Poorly

    - [Breadcrumbs: 11 Design Guidelines for Desktop and Mobile](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumbs/)
        1. Breadcrumbs should not replace the global navigation bar or the local navigation within a section.
        2. Breadcrumbs should display the current location in the site’s hierarchical structure, not the session history.
        3. For polyhierarchical sites, breadcrumbs should show a single pathway in the site’s polyhierarchy.
        4. Include the current page as the last item in the breadcrumb trail.
        5. In the breadcrumb trail, the breadcrumb corresponding to the current page should not be a link. 
        6. Breadcrumbs should include only site pages, not logical categories in your IA.
        7. Breadcrumbs aren’t necessary (or useful) for sites with flat hierarchies that are only 1 or 2 levels deep, or sites that are linear in structure.
        8. Breadcrumb trails should start with a link to the homepage.
        9. Mobile: Don’t use breadcrumbs that wrap to multiple lines.
        10. Mobile: Don’t use breadcrumbs that are too small or too crowded together.
        11. Mobile: Consider shortening the breadcrumb trail to include only the last level(s).
