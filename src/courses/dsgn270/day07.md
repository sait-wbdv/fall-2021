## 1. Netlify Serverless Functions
### Materials
- Documentation: [Serverless functions overview](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/)
    - [Javascript-specific overiew](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/)
    - [Netlify Dev - Running a local developer environment](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#netlify-dev)
- Sample code: [hello-netlify-functions](https://github.com/acidtone/hello-netlify-functions)

### Instructions
1. In a new project, create a `hello.js` function in a `functions` directory with this sample code:
    ```js
    exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({message: "Hello World"})
        };
    }
    ```
2. In the root directory, create a `netlify.toml` file with the following code:

    ```js
    [functions]
      directory = "functions"
    ```

    This tells Netlify which directory to use to load serverless functions.
3. Push this project to a new GH repo.
4. Create a new App in your Netlify team and deploy the repo you just created.
5. Test your hello world serverless function by navigating to:

    ```
    https://[site-name].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hello
    ```
