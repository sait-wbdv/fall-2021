## Housekeeping
- Question from Slack: 
    > It looks like I scored a practicum but it looks like its pretty much all wordpress. I talked to the senior dev and he said they don't do much custom work, which isn't the worst but I feel like it wont be as fulfilling as a job that uses more modern and custom frameworks. Do you think i'll forget most of my knowledge in this course over the 3 or so months for the practicum? It feels like there's more need for devs that can use frameworks and such
- Link to [Assignment 4]({{ '/assignments/cpnt200/assignment-4/' | url }}) fixed
- CPNT 200 Group Assignment - Push the due date?

## 1. Tony's Black Friday Deal
Let's take the day off after Housekeeping, work on assignments and pick up DSGN 270 on Monday (and maybe Wednesday).

The Zoom room will be open for the morning.
