## Key Takeaways
- [Avoid hamburger icons](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/hamburger-menus/). If you have to hide the navigation, use a button labelled "menu".

    1. For most apps/websites, login or registration should be optional and as many features as possible should be available without logging in.
    2. Explain the benefits of registration. What do people get by creating an account?
    3. Offer alternative methods of registration such social login or Google login. Not everyone will use these, but those who are willing to do so will be able to register more quickly and, because they will use a much-rehearsed password, will be more likely to remember it and less likely to make mistakes while typing it.
    4. Ask only for the minimum amount of information in the registration form. Ideally, email and password should be enough. Avoid asking for date of birth or other information that is not absolutely essential. If users want to get more benefits by providing additional information, they should be able to do so by editing their profile.
    5. Make the password visible. When people can see what passwords they type, they make fewer mistakes and they can review their password once entered.
    6. Disclose password constraints upfront. Nothing is more annoying than having to guess what the siteâ€™s password requirements might be, and later discovering that you guessed wrong.
    7. Display a strength meter. It will give people real-time feedback about the passwords they choose and prompt them to create stronger passwords.
    Do not repeat fields (e.g., two password fields, two email fields).
    8. Typing passwords is painful enough; typing them twice is twice as painful. Instead, allow people to see passwords (and emails) in clear to check for errors. And, at the end of the registration process, you can show a confirmation page presenting both the email they selected and the password they typed.
    9. Do not ask users to confirm their registration through email.
    10. Switching applications can disorient users and can raise roadblocks that ultimately may prevent them from attaining their original goal (which is never to register on your site). If you must confirm credentials, do so by sending users a code in a text message instead of a link through email, because that code will be easier to type without switching contexts, just by glancing at the notification displayed at the top of the screen.
    11. Allow people to use fingerprint authentication (such as TouchID) to log in.  This method will remove most pain from the login process.
    12. Offer the option of showing passwords in clear. However, unmasking does not need to be the default for login. Although we advocated for this practice for a long time, only recently sites and apps have started adopting it, and some users can feel unsecure when seeing the password characters in clear. That is why, at this stage, we recommend masking the password by default and presenting users with a Show password checkbox that allows them to unmask it.
    13. Include a Forgot password? link. Rarely used passwords are forgotten, and recovering them should be available on any device.
    - "Different devices have different capabilities of interaction and different screen sizes." IOW, don't use a hamburger menu on desktop.
