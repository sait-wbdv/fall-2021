- [What is the difference between API keys and API tokens?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/161946/what-is-the-difference-between-api-keys-and-api-tokens-usages)
- [Why and when to use API keys](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/when-why-api-key) from Google Cloud documentation

### JAMstack security and connection types
- [Are your keys secure on the JAMstack?](https://dev.to/shortdiv/are-your-keys-secure-on-the-jamstack-pin)
- [APIs and Authentication on the Jamstack ](https://css-tricks.com/apis-and-authentication-on-the-jamstack/)

### API Research
Find the developer documentation of a social API (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc) of your choice. For example: search `twitter api documentation`, `instagram api nodejs`, `github public api`, etc.
- Is there a Getting Started or Getting Connected page for the API?
- What are the API rate limits?
- What's the current version of the API?
- Are there any Javascript libraries for using the API?
- Is there a public API available for frontend requests? Does it need to be authenticated?

Based on the tutorials/guides/documentation you find, what's the easiest method of sending a request to the API?
