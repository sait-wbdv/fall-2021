## Agenda
### 1. Quality of Life Tips
- Web developement is just fancy typing.
    - Take a typing course.
    - Keep your hands on the "home row"
        - left index finger on `F`
        - right index finger on `J`
    - When using the `shift` key (other other modifier), use the opposite hand.
        - Example: for a `$` 
            - left hand on `4`
            - right hand on `shift`
- Learn your hotkeys and shortcuts
    - Key Goal: don't take your hands off the keyboard
    - Keyboard shortcuts can usually be found to the right of an application's menu options.
    - Use your system shortcuts to switch applications
        - Windows: `Alt` + `F4`
        - Mac: `Command` + `Tab`
- Use keyboard shortcuts to open applications
    - Windows: ???
    - Mac: `Command` + `spacebar` and begin typing the name of the application.
- Install a window manager such as [Divvy Window Manager](https://mizage.com/windivvy/)!
