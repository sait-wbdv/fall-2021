    <h2>Layout</h2>
<h3>List entries (example: gallery)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>List entry</dt>
<dd>Sometimes called &quot;category pages&quot; (when they contain items belonging to a specific product category), &quot;directory pages&quot; (when they list locations or people), or &quot;gallery pages&quot; (when they contain graphics or images).</dd>
<dt>Pogo sticking</dt>
<dd>Navigating from a routing page—a search-engine results page (SERP), section landing page, product-category page, or similar—to a page deeper in the site’s hierarchy, then immediately back to the routing page</dd>
</dl>
<p>To avoid the need for the user to pogo stick:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prioritize list-entry attributes to create an information hierarchy</strong><br>
The amount of product detail in the list entry needs to be just right: too much will overload users and prevent them from seeing enough choices in one view, too little will make them pogo stick.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect attribute priorities in the mini-IA and visual design of each list entry</strong><br>
Treat each list entry as if it were a small webpage and make sure that your layout and visual treatment of each attribute within that description matches its priority relative to other attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Use consistent styling across list entries to support comparison</strong><br>
In other words, the same piece information should be represented in the same place using the same visual treatment. (See: the amazon example in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zhhc5pzE9Y">Design principles: Repetition</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/8zhhc5pzE9Y?t=148">@2:28</a>)</li>

<h3>Cards</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Definition</dt>
<dd>A card is container for a few short, related pieces of information. It roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Cards have 4 key properties</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards are used for grouping information.</li>
<li>Cards present a summary and link to additional details.</li>
<li>Cards resemble physical cards.</li>
<li>Cards allow for flexible layouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Cards Are Useful</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards are better suited when users browse for information than when they search.
<ul>
<li>Card layouts typically deemphasize the ranking of content.</li>
<li>Card layouts are less scannable than lists.</li>
<li>Cards take more space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cards work best for collections of heterogeneous items (i.e. not all the content is of the same basic type).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Footers</h3>
<p>Some of the most common footer components, examples, and recommended situations in which to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility links</li>
<li>Doormat navigation</li>
<li>Secondary-task links</li>
<li>Site map</li>
<li>Testimonials or awards</li>
<li>Brands within the organization</li>
<li>Customer engagement (email newsletters and social media)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content</h2>
<h3>Headings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Heading</dt>
<dd>The headline that acts as a title of a section of text.</dd>
<dt>Header</dt>
<dd>The banner at the top of a website that usually contains the logo and navigation.</dd>
<dt><code>head</code></dt>
<dd>The HTML element that contains the meta data of a web page.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Attractive headlines and titles are critical in making the right first impression. Concise titles that sound authentic and relevant get noticed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the headline works out of context.</li>
<li>Tell readers something useful.</li>
<li>Don’t succumb to cute or faddish vocabulary.</li>
<li>Omit nonessential words.</li>
<li>Front-load headings with strong keywords.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Text links</h3>
<ul>
<li>While blue is still the safest link color, other colors work just as well as long as the links stand out clearly from the body text. If you don’t have a particular reason to prefer another color, we still recommend blue as the safest choice.</li>
<li>The position of links can help you determine whether or not underlining is necessary. The navigation menu and lists, especially along the peripheral areas of the page, don’t require underlining. Their locations identify them as links.</li>
<li>Test your color choice for hyperlinks to make sure that people who have colorblindness can spot them easily.</li>
<li>Static items should not have the same color as hyperlinks.</li>
<li>Don’t use blue text (or underline text) for nonclickable items.</li>
<li>Whatever appearance you choose for hyperlinks, make sure to apply the same treatment consistently throughout your site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buttons</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make buttons at least remotely resemble physical buttons</strong>. In order for an object to be recognizable, it must retain the right visual cues to trigger the right associations quickly and accurately. Retain the rectangular shape (preferably with rounded corners) if you renounce the 3-D effect. Interactive components in flat design should look clickable even without heavier effects such as shadows and gradients. (In one early study, clicks increased by 416% after changing from flat to 3-D buttons. While the effect is smaller now, it's still big.)</li>
<li>Conversely, <strong>don’t make nonclickable items look like buttons</strong>. For example, giving headings a background color will make them resemble buttons when they’re not.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on content hierarchy within the page</strong>. Avoid having many colorful boxes of different sizes on a page. People have difficulty picking out the clickable elements when similar-looking items compete with each other.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Images and Graphics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure smaller images enlarge when clicked.</li>
<li>Make all elements (e.g., picture, icon, text) that are associated with each other clickable. Doing so increases the target size and improves the probability of capturing an intended click.</li>
<li>Avoid multiple calls to action for a given image unless the options within that image are plainly presented, such as a bulleted list of hyperlinks or clearly labeled buttons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>Despite their advantages, icons often cause usability problems when they are designed without consideration for their many potential downsides.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Universal&quot; icons are rare,
<ul>
<li>Exceptions: &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Print&quot; and &quot;Search&quot; (hamburger icon is close but sometimes represents a generic list)</li>
<li>Example: &quot;Heart&quot; and &quot;Star&quot; have overlapping and sometimes competing meanings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Icons need a text label</li>
<li>Relative size aids noticeability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips for creating your own:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the design simple and schematic. Reduce the amount of graphic details by focusing on the basic characteristics of the object rather than creating a highly realistic image in order to speed up recognition. (Intricate details are difficult to distinguish at smaller sizes.)</li>
<li>Use the 5-second rule: if it takes you more than 5 seconds to think of an appropriate icon for something, it is unlikely that an icon can effectively communicate that meaning.</li>
<li>Test the icons for recognizability: ask people what they expect the icons to stand for.</li>
<li>Test the icons for memorability: ask a repeat set of users if they can remember the icon’s meaning after being told what it represented a couple weeks earlier.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bulleted Lists</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write list items to have approximately similar line lengths.</li>
<li>Use numbered lists only when the sequence or count of items are important.</li>
<li>Use parallel sentence construction for list items.</li>
<li>Avoid repeating the same word(s) at the beginning of each list item.</li>
<li>Introduce a list with a clear, descriptive sentence or phrase.</li>
<li>Keep formatting consistent.</li>
<li>Don’t overuse bulleted lists, as they can lose their effectiveness.</li>
</ol>
