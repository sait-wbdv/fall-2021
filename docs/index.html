    <h2>House Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cameras on:
<ol>
<li>8-9am</li>
<li>During breakout discussions and when paired coding</li>
<li>After 2pm</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Be an excellent neighbour:
<ul>
<li>People are allowed to like (and not like) things;</li>
<li>Work the problem before asking for help;</li>
<li>Teach a skill you've learned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask a question any time during a live stream. There are no dumb questions (maybe silly ones).</li>
<li>One-on-ones: DM your instructor anytime to book a time for a confidential video/audio chat. Note: this is not for tutoring, see below.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Sidebars</h2>
<p>Direct Message your instructor at any time if you have a private non-coding concern or question.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting programming help</h2>
<p>There is only one instructor (per course) but many students. Three key skills we will be teaching in this program are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Independent learning</li>
<li>How to ask for help</li>
<li>Knowing when to ask for help</li>
</ol>
<p>These are skills employers look for when they hire Juniors.</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>We recommend you follow these steps when you run into a problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Troubleshoot! This is how you learn to code: through your fingers.
<ul>
<li>Are there syntax errors?</li>
<li>Did you validate your code?</li>
<li>Can you reproduce the error reliably?</li>
<li>Any theories?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using the proper terminology, search for solutions online;
<ul>
<li>And learn to recognize the quality of a search result;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More troubleshooting!</li>
<li><a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Talk to a rubber duck</a>;
<ul>
<li>It seems silly but just talking through a problem out loud will often lead to a potential solution. The mind is funny that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you're still stuck, ask for help (and be respectful of someone's time) from:
<ul>
<li>your classmates, using the <code>#fall-2021</code> Slack channel (so others can benefit from the discussion);</li>
<li>outside nerds, such as forums, Discord servers, etc;</li>
<li>your instructor, keeping in mind they will ask you if you've attempted any of the above steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Slack best practices</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>@mention</code> someone if it's important or a direct reply to someone's message. This will send the person a notification (by default) but don't overuse it.</li>
<li>Can your question be answered by a classmate? Consider posting it in <code>#fall-2021</code> instead of a Direct Message. The answer will probably be of use to the rest of the group (don't forget to work the problem yourself, first).</li>
<li>Don't wait for someone to be online before asking them a question. Just ask the question and give the person some time to respond.
<ul>
<li>The goal of asynchronous messaging apps is to provide enough information so that someone can help while you're offline.</li>
<li>Think like you're sending an email (asynchronous), not live chatting (synchronous).</li>
<li>Examples of flawed Slack messages:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hi @tony&quot; (and then nothing after)</li>
<li>&quot;@tony I'd like to ask a question&quot; (and then nothing after)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples of great Slack messages:
<ul>
<li>&quot;<em>I can't figure out how to move this button to the left. Any ideas? Screencap attached! Here's a link to the GitHub code! I think it's a problem with line 25.</em>&quot;
<ul>
<li>You've been staring at the same code for awhile. Others haven't. Point them in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;<em>@katy Free at 5pm for a strategy chat? If not, I'm free tomorrow during lunch.</em>&quot;
<ul>
<li>Providing backup options reduce the need for back-and-forth discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Want to meet any past grads? Post a message in <code>#general</code>.</li>
</ul>
