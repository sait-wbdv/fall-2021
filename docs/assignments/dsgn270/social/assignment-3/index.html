        <h1>DSGN 270 Assignment 3 - Social Integration Proof-of-Concept</h1>
<p>Outcome: Integrate social media content into a website.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will build a small proof-of-concept social media integration that you can promote to a potential market of clients.</p>
<h2>Potential APIs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Youtube, Twitch, Vimeo, TikTok</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Shopify, Etsy</li>
<li>Reddit, 4Chan</li>
<li>GitHub, Codepen</li>
<li>Pintrest</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>Vibr</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Define a market of potential businesses to sell your product/service to. For example:
<ul>
<li>Bars and restaurants</li>
<li>Retail stores</li>
<li>Teachers/instructors</li>
<li>Other developers (or a product/service you can use yourself)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define a need for that market that can be solved by displaying their social media content on their own website. For example:
<ul>
<li>Local pub posts their daily specials on Instragram but they don't have time to update their website daily.</li>
<li>A carpenter would like to display daily Twitter progress photos of their latest project on their portfolio website.</li>
<li>A martial arts instructor would like to display their Youtube video series (on how to properly kick a hole through a wall) on the fight club website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select a social media platform with a developer API that you can use to request the required content.
<ul>
<li>Create a test account on that platform in the name of a fake client.</li>
<li>Post relevant content to that account that you can request with the developer API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a secure platform of your choice, display this content on a webpage so that it solves your defined problem.</li>
<li>Create user documentation describing to the client how to update their content on the Social Media platform so that it updates on their website.</li>
<li>Create developer documentation outlining the steps taken to set up the API connection in case it needs to be repeated.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Marking Rubric - 50 points</h2>
<p>Each of the following criteria will be worth 10 points.</p>
<h3>1. Market and Problem definition - 10 points</h3>
<ul>
<li>5 points: Define a User Story for your target client. It should follow the <a href="/fall-2021/courses/dsgn270/day03/">format covered in the first half of this course</a>:
<ul>
<li>As a bar owner, I'd like my <code>#daily-special</code> Instagram updates to show up on my website because some of my regulars don't use social media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 points: 100-150 word summary of the market and problem that your social media integration solves
<ul>
<li>What's the target market for this integration? Who would pay to have this installed on their website?</li>
<li>What problem/pain does the integration solve?</li>
<li>How does the choice of social tool contribute to the solution?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Test account with sample content - 10 points</h2>
<p>Choose a social media tool that solves your market problem and User Story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new account; do not use your actual account. You may use one of the following for an email address:
<ul>
<li>SAIT email account;</li>
<li>Email attached to a free <code>.me</code> domain (available with the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Developer Pack</a>);</li>
<li>Your primary email with <a href="https://will.koffel.org/post/2014/using-email-plus-addressing/">plus addressing</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Account contains at least three non-lorem posts that support the defined market and problem.
<ul>
<li>Content does not have to be original and can be based on open source content.</li>
<li>Content must support the User Story (i.e. a &quot;daily special&quot; post should be an image of food, not a sunset).</li>
<li>Talk to your instructor if three posts is not appropriate for the social tool you have chosen. For example, you're not expected to edit three separate videos for a YouTube integration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Operational integration with Task Flow - 10 points</h2>
<p>Create a public web page that displays social content in a way that supports your User Story.</p>
<p>To be included in the project README. Define instructions as a Task Flow for the potential client to test the integration. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to web page and take note of the current content.
<ul>
<li>content can be displayed using an embed strategy offered by the social tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Log into social tool (include creds in brightspace comment).</li>
<li>Make a change or add a new post in social tool admin.</li>
<li>Refresh output page to confirm content has changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempts should be made to extend the functionality beyond any examples covered in class. In other words, don't just copy what your instructor did.</li>
<li>Points given for unique use of the tool that goes beyond simply displaying content. For example:
<ul>
<li>Content only displayed when a particular hashtag is present in description.</li>
<li>Displaying content that is added to a particular collection.</li>
<li>Displaying a list with pagination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task can be to create a new post (i.e. new &quot;daily special&quot; OR edit the existing content in some significant way that supports the User Story (i.e. label an existing post as &quot;featured&quot; to change the output of the integration).</li>
<li>One of the three non-lorem posts may be used as sample content for the client to use to create a new post.</li>
<li>Include relevant supporting links from the user documentation of the social tool you've chosen (i.e. &quot;How to create an Instagram Post&quot; from the IG website).</li>
<li>Your instructor will follow these instructions to mark this assignment so be clear and concise.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Custom Branding using an API endpoint - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 points: Output content from a Developer API to show that content can be displayed with a custom design and brand colours.</li>
<li>5 points: In the project README, include relevant links from the Developer API Documentation:
<ul>
<li>General Usage</li>
<li>Rate limits</li>
<li>Authentication methods</li>
<li>Creating a token</li>
<li>Endpoint Reference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Secure API token/key - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Points given for not displaying API key or token in public source code.</li>
<li>You may use a method of your choice to do this, such as:
<ul>
<li>A proxy endpoint created in Node or a serverless function.</li>
<li>Calling the API during the build process of a framework such as Eleventy or Nuxt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your README, include details of how you secured your API, along with links to relevant documentation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>General Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>README should use elements of visual hierarchy to make content readable. For example:
<ul>
<li>Use proper headings to label the sections of the Rubric (Market/Problem definition, usage instructions, API documentation, etc)</li>
<li>Use code blocks when appropriate</li>
<li>Step-by-step instructions should use numbered lists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Code should follow proper conventions (indentation, naming, etc);</li>
<li>README and integration should reflect a real-world solution to a market problem that a client would find valuable.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Submitting Your Assignment</h2>
<p>In order to receive a grade, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy your integration using a hosting method of your choice (i.e. GH Pages, Heroku, Netlify, etc).</li>
<li>In addition to the requirements of the assignment, include the following in your project <code>README.md</code>:
<ul>
<li>Course title and author name;</li>
<li>Any comments that may help squeeze marks out of your instructor (maybe give him hints on where to look for the requirements above);</li>
<li>Attributions for any code or assets that are not your own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zip your project (excluding <code>node_modules</code> and <code>.env</code> file) and submit them to Brightspace.</li>
<li>Include the following as a comment with your Brightspace submission:
<ul>
<li>Relevant GH repo(s);</li>
<li>Live integration link;</li>
<li>Link to the social media test account;</li>
<li>Login information for the social media test account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Appendix Example platforms:</h2>
<h3>1. JAMstack with proxy</h3>
<ul>
<li>No backend server</li>
<li>API calls come from a static website</li>
<li>Use a serverless function (i.e. on Netlify) to secure the API Key</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Nuxt build</h3>
<ul>
<li>API is called at build time (secure)</li>
<li>Content is displayed statically after it's generated at build time</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Node as proxy</h3>
<ol>
<li>Custom API is called from your page to your Node endpoint.</li>
<li>Node requests data from the API on the backend (secure).</li>
<li>Node sends the response data back to the client.</li>
</ol>
